# Aura: Master of the Elements

## Synopsis

This is a Top Down RPG Project written in C++ utilizing Unreal Engine 5.4.2. This project contains both C++ code and Blueprint code for various different mechanisms within the game. 

## Learning Points

The different things I've learned about so far during this project contain:

- Setting up C++ classes for base actor functionality and practicing inheritance for child classes of the parent actor class.
- Blueprint classes & Animation Blueprint classes for common enemy animations and needed functionality
- PostProcess Volumes for enemy highlighting in game, and using C++ to set custom material values to dynamically highlight enemies under the mouse cursor
- UE5 Enhanced Input, Input Actions, Input Action Mappings, and associated C++ code for Player movement
- Refining movement values using FRotators to smooth out player rotation as movement occurs
- Game Mode C++ class
- Skeletal Meshes and adding sockets to skeletal meshes to combine character meshes and weapon meshes
